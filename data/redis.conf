# Redis configuration file

# Note on memory overcommit:
# Redis is designed to crash by design when it runs out of memory. However, if you want to be sure, you can
# enable the vm.overcommit_memory sysctl option. This will cause the kernel to check if there is enough
# memory available before allocating it to Redis.
#
# You can enable this option by adding the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf:
#
# vm.overcommit_memory = 1
#
# And then running the following command:
#
# sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1

# If you want to use a different database number, change the value of 'dbfilename'
# to the filename of the database you want to use.
dbfilename redis_data.rdb

# The working directory.
#
# The DB will be written inside this directory, with the filename specified above.
#
# The Append Only File will also be created inside this directory.
#
# Note that you must specify a directory here, not a file name.
dir /data

# By default Redis does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
# Note that Redis will write a pid file in /var/run/redis.pid when daemonized.
daemonize no

# If you want Redis to listen on a specific IP, you can set the 'bind' option to the
# IP address you want it to listen on.
#
# bind 127.0.0.1

# The port that Redis should listen on.
port 6379

# Accept connections on the specified IP address. An empty string means
# all IPv4 addresses.
#
# If Redis is running in a container, you may want to listen on all available
# network interfaces by setting to '0.0.0.0'
bind 0.0.0.0

# If you want to enable protected mode, which will make Redis require
# clients to authenticate before processing any other commands, set this
# option to yes.
#
# protected-mode yes

# A comma-separated list of IP addresses that are allowed to connect to Redis
# in protected mode.
#
# If you want to allow all IPs, use '0.0.0.0/0'
0.0.0.0/0
# protected-mode-allowed-ips 0.0.0.0/0
